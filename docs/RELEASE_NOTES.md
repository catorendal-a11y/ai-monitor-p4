# AI Monitor v1.17.2

Windows command discovery now ignores npm's extensionless POSIX shell launcher and selects a Windows `.exe` or supported `.cmd`/`.bat` wrapper instead. This fixes Codex quota reads from an Explorer-launched app when the development terminal had a different PATH. Existing Codex sign-in is reused; no new account or key is imported.

A full uninstall, flash erase and GUI first-installation test found a P4 bootloader defect that application-only updates did not expose: the factory image declared 4 MB flash while its board and partition table require 16 MB. The write/hash check succeeded, but the board then boot-looped. The build now explicitly sets the image header to 16 MB.

- Packaging and first-installation preflight validate the bootloader flash capacity, partition checksum, bounds, alignment, overlap and application fit. Valid file hashes alone are insufficient to approve an image.
- Factory validation runs before collecting firmware and before invoking a flasher. Existing application-only updates remain separate.
- Disabled primary buttons now look disabled during a firmware write. Closing the window during writing remains blocked.
- Firmware completion reports a started process and asks users to check USB/provider health, rather than claiming the display is already connected. It respects the saved stop-on-close preference.
- The multiple-port warning no longer incorrectly claims a previous host exists.

v1.17.0's P4 factory image must not be used for new installations. Published assets have not been overwritten. Windows binaries remain unsigned, and S3 still requires physical validation.

# AI Monitor v1.17.0

The Windows host now separates background-process status, verified USB connection and provider quota health. Two matching devices no longer produce a misleading successful start. Select the display port explicitly; the existing host is preserved when preflight fails.

- New **Host settings**: USB retry interval, local token read interval, terminal text size, opt-in start when opening the app, and keep/stop host when closing it. No Windows service or startup task is installed.
- **Check connection** reads the display identity without writing firmware or requesting AI quota. A busy host is left alone; wrong hardware and missing firmware get actionable instructions.
- Codex discovers its official per-user native installation even when an Explorer-launched app has an older PATH. Account quota uses read-only CLI RPC, with no model turn.
- **Check AI setup** checks each selected local token source from the app. Unsupported automatic editor integrations are explicitly labeled; no account quota is fabricated.
- A dedicated **AI setup** tab keeps provider choices, instructions and key entry separate from the display connection controls. **Provider setup** opens that tab; Codex has its own official install/sign-in action.
- Claude's optional subscription quota link can be installed and removed in Setup. Installation is idempotent, keeps a private backup, and preserves custom statuslines. The frozen GUI always targets the console helper.
- OpenCode has a built-in read-only numeric SQLite adapter for documented V1 message and V2 session usage. No integration script is needed for these schemas. NOVA/ORBIT Settings explains its activity-only support.
- USB selection shows device descriptions. Rescanning preserves the explicit port and no longer marks unchanged settings as unsaved.
- Saved USB changes interrupt disconnected retry waits promptly. Local token polling stays independent of quota refresh; provider backoff survives USB reconnects.
- Corrupt local configuration opens the app's recovery screen. Explicit recovery backs up the original private bytes locally before resetting; valid configurations cannot be reset this way.
- Unsaved changes are checked before closing. Firmware errors retain their specific instructions instead of a generic failure.
- Local health snapshots use fresh process IDs and bounded atomic files. Keys, prompts, account replies and telemetry databases are excluded from release exports.

The default remains: no board/provider preselection, no automatic host start, and the host keeps running after closing the app. Installer upgrades preserve private settings. The new Windows host also works with existing v1.16.1 displays; the firmware update adds revised provider guidance in Settings.

**Windows trust:** binaries remain unsigned. No Windows security controls are disabled. Trusted signing/reputation requires a real publisher certificate and cannot be replaced by version metadata.

# AI Monitor v1.16.1

- **SET > AI USAGE** explains each provider's quota windows and PC setup. Each choice shows remaining quota and REPORTED/NOT REPORTED/OFFLINE/ERROR/UPDATING/STALE status.
- Known windows can be selected while waiting for data, without fabricated percentages. Live values update in Settings without rebinding touch targets; REFRESH reloads choices explicitly.
- ZCode now includes the monthly MCP tool quota and correctly labels its model weekly quota as 7 DAYS. Monthly MCP is not a monthly model-token budget.
- Missing-data, live-update, quota selection, text layout and ZCode API fixtures are covered by regression tests.

# AI Monitor v1.16.0

The NOVA/ORBIT companion panel is narrower, leaving more room for readable AI status and usage on the right. The robot keeps its original size and is recentered by trimming transparent canvas margins.

- Companion card: 430 to 350 pixels wide. Provider area: 310 to 390 pixels wide.
- Percentages: 26 to 40 pixels. Provider names: 14 to 20 pixels. Quota-window/status text: 12 to 16 pixels.
- Larger activity headings, token messages and navigation captions, with checks for clipping and overlap across every provider and tiny/full/LOCAL values.
- Updated actual LVGL previews for NOVA, ORBIT and the four themes.
- 29 linked project badges in README, including live release/commit/build/star badges and accurate board, provider, feature and privacy information. Experimental/activity-only integrations remain explicitly labeled.

The previous per-provider **SET > QUOTA WINDOW** preferences, larger notifications and guided Windows installer remain available. Existing selections survive application updates; missing windows remain unavailable and alerts still watch all windows.

- Larger notifications: 136-pixel banner, 24-pixel heading, 20-pixel quota text and a 60-pixel-high DISMISS button.
- Visible instructions for all eight AI choices, including ZCode's Coding Plan key, official Codex/Claude setup and activity-only bridge requirements.
- **AI-Monitor-Setup-v1.16.0-windows.exe** installs the complete app for the current user and opens setup. No Python, PlatformIO or administrator rights are required. The portable ZIP remains available.
- Double-clicking the command-line firmware helper explains its purpose and offers to open the graphical Firmware tab. Writes retain progress/error messages; the app cannot close during a write and can start the host after success.
- Packaged Qt diagnostics invoke the exact flasher child on both images without USB writes. Installer checks cover clean setup, runtime startup, upgrade and settings-preserving uninstall.
- The independent host keeps running after closing the app, until stopped, sign-out or shutdown. Private keys/configuration are not distributed.

**Windows trust:** this release is unsigned. SmartScreen may warn; version metadata and an installer do not replace trusted signing/reputation. Windows protections remain enabled. See the Windows trust guide included in the package.

**Hardware:** P4 and the original Waveshare S3 have separate firmware. S3 remains experimental and unverified on physical S3 hardware; B/C variants are unsupported. Use an application update on an existing AI Monitor to retain settings; First installation resets them. Stop a portable host from its original folder before switching to the installer version.
